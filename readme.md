# OpenSCAD Models [![Travis](https://img.shields.io/travis/jameswilddev/openscad-models.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/jameswilddev/openscad-models) [![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/jameswilddev/openscad-models.svg)](https://github.com/jameswilddev/openscad-models/blob/master/license)

This is a big dump of everything I work on with OpenSCAD.

See the [models](models) directory for more.

## Continuous Integration

All files of the pattern `*.render.scad` are rendered to both STL and PNG and
pushed to GitHub as releases.

Only the file name is included (not the path), so ensure that any files to be
rendered have a unique name.
